class memoize(object):
    """cache the return value of a method

    This class is meant to be used as a decorator of methods. The return value
    from a given method invocation will be cached on the instance whose method
    was invoked. All arguments passed to a method decorated with memoize must
    be hashable.

    If a memoized method is invoked directly on its class the result will not
    be cached. Instead the method will be invoked like a static method:

    class Obj(object):
        @memoize
        def add_to(self, arg):
            return self + arg

    Obj.add_to(1) # not enough arguments
    Obj.add_to(1, 2) # returns 3, result is not cached
