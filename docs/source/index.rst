Welcome to End-to-End Latency Analysis Framework's documentation!
=================================================================

Welcome to End-to-End Latency Analysis Framework's documentation.
This documentation is divided into different parts.
I recommend that you get started with :ref:`installation`
and then head over to the :ref:`quickstart`. If you'd rather
dive into the internals of the library, check out
the :ref:`api` documentation.

This framwork depends on two external libraries: the `numpy`_
and the `argparse`_. These libraries are not documented here.
If you want to dive into their documentation, check out
the following links:

-   `Numpy Documentation <http://docs.scipy.org/doc/>`_
-   `Argparse Documentation <http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html>`_

.. _Numpy: http://docs.scipy.org/doc/
.. _Argparse: http://docs.python.org/dev/library/argparse.html
